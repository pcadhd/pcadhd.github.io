        <p>I went to the road to hana in Maui, Hawaii. It had very beautiful waterfalls in between the bays and there were cloud forest on either side of me as I was driving through the mountain on the mud road.</p>

        <p> I went surfing at break wall. It was easy to swim out into the surf because of how the clean the waves were breaking. The surf spot is names breakwall because there isnt really a shore - you jump off of a concrete wall. the wall blocks the waves from hitting the boats in the port. Sometimes I noticed that you have to be careful because the current can be strong and can suck you back to shore (the wall or rocks next to it.)
